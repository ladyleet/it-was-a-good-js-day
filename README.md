Sweet JS Rap Lyrics

These frameworks and libraries 

angular vue react rxjs please

I don’t know about you I’m betting on that web platform those polyfills make it ease-y you got to tell me why safari can’t you just hang with the rest of the gang 

it’s kind of a pain that you called progressive web apps it’s own name. 

it just ain’t the same

Then, let’s get into rxjs that reactive programming, bless. Why promises, state sometimes ain’t a good thing. 

Stateless let’s you reuse in components that are listening, subscribing. 

Sharereplay is my fave operator today, letting http replay .... a value you take 

but don’t make a mistake. Make sure to subscribe. for goodness sake. 

And to clean up memory... management unsubscribe and update your state. 

Now angular angular that framework making it simpler. 

To write web components, calling them angular elements. 

And Ng rx- is the sex-Iest thing I’ve sver seen. Using rxjs for reactive programming.

Give me some vue, a library you never knew, til npm told them 

that GitHub stars was a thing, and vue was leading... 

with people loving the simplicity - seems like angular, react maybe.

Compile all that to es2015 with a thing, we call webpack. 
It’s a one track, fast track to understand how to use this stack. 

And Addy osmani is asking people how he.. 

can help people be... 

better web devs with this mess... 

of bundling. Decrease that size decrease that size. 

Light house scores will blow your mind. 

Optimization componentization....

Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dogs, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl want to dig out
Hooked it up on later as I hit the do'
Thinking will i live another twenty fo'
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking brothers every way like M.J.
I can't believe, today was a good day
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a niggas direction as I ran the intersection
Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break 'em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day
Left my niggas house paid
Picked up a girl been tryin' to fuck since the twelfth grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep so deep so deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
she didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the morning got the fat burger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cube's a pimp (yeah)
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I got to say it was a good day
Hey wait, wait a minute fool stop the shit
What the fuck am I thinking about?
